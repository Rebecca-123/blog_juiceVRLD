            "content": ". Lesson Purpose . Understand how to write classes with attributes and methods (Java OOP) . . Hack 1 . Write the first part of the Cow class, with the body consisting of the instance variables and constructors . | If the &quot;Output produced&quot; cell is blank, there is no output produced from the code segment . | . . 5.1 Anatomy of a Class . . Methods . Define what an object can do or the behavior of an object | Can access and use the object&#39;s instance variables ### Main Method | . public static void main​(String[] args){ } . String[] args: an array consisting of command-line arguments (Strings) | . // Basic Java Class public class Snack { // class name always starts with capital letter /* * Instance variables * Always declared right after class declaration * Declared with TYPE and NAME */ private String name; private int calories; // constructor public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } // methods public String getName(){ // accessor return name; } public void setName(String n){ // mutator name = n; } // main method public static void main(String[] args) { Snack one = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); System.out.println(one.getName()); } } Snack.main(null); . Oreos . Access Modifiers . . Data Encapsulation . Data can be accessible or modifiable, BOTH, or NEITHER | . . Read-Only . Instance variables are declared with the private keyword ==&gt; outside the class, the instance variables can only be accessed via public methods of the class | . public class Cow { // instance variables private String cowType; private String sound; private int numMilkings; // constructor public Cow (String cowType, String sound){ this.numMilkings = 0; this.cowType = cowType; this.sound = sound; } public String getSound(){ return sound; } } public class CowDriver{ public static void main(String[] args) { Cow myCow = new Cow(&quot;holstein&quot;, &quot;moo&quot;); System.out.println(myCow.getSound()); // myCow.sound = &quot;bark!&quot;; } } CowDriver.main(null); . moo . public class Snack { private String name; private int calories; public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } public String getName(){ // accessor return name; } } public class SnackDriver { public static void main(String[] args) { Snack one = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); System.out.println(one.getName()); // only accessible with getter System.out.println(one.name); } } SnackDriver.main(null); . | System.out.println(one.name); name has private access in Snack . Write-Only . public class Snack { private String name; private int calories; public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } public void setName(String n){ // accessor name = n; } } public class SnackDriver { public static void main(String[] args) { Snack one = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); one.setName(&quot;Double Stuffed Oreos&quot;); // only accessible with setter one.name = &quot;Golden Oreos&quot;; } } SnackDriver.main(null); . | one.name = &#34;Golden Oreos&#34;; name has private access in Snack . 5.2 Constructors . . Every instance of the Snack class has the attributes name and calories | . . public class Snack { private String name; private int calories; /* * Constructors * Syntax: * Written after instance variables, before methods * Name must match name of the class * No return type */ // default constructor public Snack(){ name = null; calories = 0; } // constructor parameters (n and c) are local variables for the constructor only // you cannot use n and c anywhere else unless you specify them as parameters for another method public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } public String getName(){ // accessor return name; } public static void main(String[] args) { Snack one = new Snack(); System.out.println(&quot;Using Default Constructor: &quot; + one.getName()); Snack two = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); System.out.println(&quot;Using Two Constructor: &quot; + two.getName()); } } Snack.main(null); . Using Default Constructor: null Using Two Constructor: Oreos . . Hack 2 . Write a default constructor and all-argument constructor for the Cow class Hint: all-argument constructor should have 3 parameters | . | Create 3 objects, with each object using a different constructor ie object1 uses default constructor, object2 uses constructor with 2 parameters... | . | . 5.3 Comments . Ignored by compiler, not executed | Make code more readable for humans or prevent execution when testing | Are NOT required on AP Exam | . Types . Multi-line comments (/**/) | Single-line comments (//) | Javadoc comments Javadoc tool that comes with the Java JDK can pull out comments and create a web page with all your comments | . | . Other Vocab . Precondition: condition that must be true before execution of a code block Methods don&#39;t need to check preconditions | . | Postcondition: condition that is ALWAYS true after the execution of a code block Outcome | State of instance variables | . | . 5.4 Accessor Method (Getters) . Allows other objects outside of the class to obtain values of instance variables or static variables | Non-void method returns a single value Header includes return type (String, int, Long etc) | . | &quot;return by value&quot;: return expression at the end of a method will specify that value that will be returned (must correspond to the type) | Must be used when different classes need to access the instance variables | . // always public // must specify return type // getVariable (typical naming convention) // no parameters public String getVariable(){ } . toString() Method . Overridden method that provides description of a specific object (ie values of instance variables) | If System.out.print or System.out.println() is passed an object, that object&#39;s toString() method is called ==&gt; returned string is printed Java default toString() will return a hashcode, but you can manually write your own toString() method | . | . // method header always stays the same // always returns string // no parameters public String toString(){ } . Example . public class Snack { private String name; private int calories; public Snack(String n, int c){ name = n; calories = c; } // return values of instance variables public String toString(){ return &quot;Name: &quot; + name + &quot;; &quot; + &quot;Calories: &quot; + calories; } public static void main(String[] args) { Snack two = new Snack(&quot;Oreos&quot;, 100); System.out.println(two); } } Snack.main(null); . Name: Oreos; Calories: 100 . 5.5 Mutator Method (Modifier/Setter) . Typically a void method that changes value of instance variables or static variables void methods do not return values | . | Must be used when different classes need to modify instance variables | . // always public void // setVariable (naming convention) // parameter type must match type of instance variable being modified public void setVariable(String variable){ this.variable = variable; } . Hack 3 . Create the toString method for the Cow class | Create at least one accessor and one mutator method for the Cow class | Call the getter and setter methods for one of your Cow objects | . 5.6 Writing Methods . Hack 4 . Add verse three with the rhyme “knee” to The Old Man Song | Add verse four with the rhyme &quot;door&quot; | . public class Song { /** Verse - prints out a verse of the song * @param number - a String like &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, etc. * @param rhyme - a String like &quot;thumb&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, etc. */ public void verse(String number, String rhyme) { System.out.println(&quot;This old man, he played &quot; + number); System.out.println(&quot;He played knick knack on my &quot; + rhyme); } // The chorus method public void chorus() { System.out.println(&quot;With a knick knack paddy whack, give a dog a bone.&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;This old man came rolling home.&quot;); } public static void main(String args[]) { Song mySong = new Song(); mySong.verse(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;thumb&quot;); mySong.chorus(); mySong.verse(&quot;two&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;); mySong.chorus(); } } Song.main(null); . This old man, he played one He played knick knack on my thumb With a knick knack paddy whack, give a dog a bone. This old man came rolling home. This old man, he played two He played knick knack on my shoe With a knick knack paddy whack, give a dog a bone. This old man came rolling home. .",
